# RiskWise Analysis

This project analyses the value/productivity and emissions intensity from various N and rotation strategies to provide growers with a better understanding of the economic outcome and risk vs reward of their major cropping decisions. 
Using field trial data, **crop yields, nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), GHG emmisions, gross margins and more** are examined. 
This code base provides tools for **data visualisation, statistical analysis, and gross margin calculations** based on different nitrogen strategies and crop rotations.

## üìÇ Project Structure

- `DataMaster.xlsx` ‚Äì Input dataset containing yearly crop data.
- `Config.py` ‚Äì Input analysis assumptions and parameters.
- `RiskWise.py` ‚Äì Main analysis script that:
  - Reads and filters data for the selected year.
  - Generates key graphs for yield, protein, screenings, and NUE.
  - Computes gross margins based on nitrogen application and grain prices.
  - Performs statistical analysis on nitrogen efficiency.
